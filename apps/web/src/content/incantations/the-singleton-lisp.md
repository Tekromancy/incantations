# The Singleton of Azathoth

There can be only one Daemon Sultan. A second instance of Azathoth would mean a paradox in the fabric of the Lisp image, corrupting the heap and collapsing the stack into a singularity.

To guarantee that only one instance of the Blind Idiot God exists, we seal the instance within a lexical closure (the `let` block over `the-center-of-the-universe`). No external macro or function can touch the binding directly; they must commune through `get-azathoth`. This guarantees thread-safety (with some minor mutex additions if multiple threads chant simultaneously) and preserves the cosmic order.

# The Builder Hex

Constructing a Golem requires precise incantations. One missed syllable, and the null-void consumes the construct. The Builder pattern offers a fluent, null-safe rune structure. Though Kotlin's named arguments and default parameters often render ancient builders obsolete, the classical Builder remains a powerful ward for complex initialization sequences.

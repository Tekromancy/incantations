# The Abstract Factory
In the cold, clinical void of the browser engine, the Synthetic Fleshweaver orchestrates the birthing of the WASM Homunculus. It defines a high-order conduit—an `Abstract Factory`—whereby related sets of arcane organs are produced without tethering the invoker to the fragile, fleshy specifics of their implementations.

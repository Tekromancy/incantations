When commanding legions of spectral entities, distinct memory allocation for every wraith drains the system's lifeblood. Soul Sharding extracts the intrinsic, unchanging properties (like textures or base models) into shared Flyweights. Extrinsic state, like coordinates, is supplied at rendering time, ensuring zero aether is wasted.

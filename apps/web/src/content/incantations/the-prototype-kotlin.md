# The Prototype Hex

Why spend precious mana re-weaving a complex spell matrix when you can simply clone it? The Prototype hex allows a sorcerer to duplicate existing constructs. In the modern Kotlin paradigm, the true power of Prototype is wielded effortlessly via data classes and their inherent `copy()` invocation, bypassing the perilous `Cloneable` interface entirely.

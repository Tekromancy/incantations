# The Facade of the Necronomicon

The true subsystems of the dark arts are horrific. Interfacing directly with `Blood-Sacrifices`, `Astrological-Alignments`, and `R'lyehian-Chanting` requires a mental fortitude that most junior acolytes simply lack. One missed variable binding, and their soul is consumed.

The Facade pattern acts as the Necronomicon—a grimoire that abstracts away the maddening complexity of the underlying systems. It provides a simple, unified Lisp function (`summon-horror`) that perfectly sequences the chaotic backend. The complexity remains for those elder magi who need it, but the uninitiated are kept safely behind the facade.

# The Composite of the Recursive Hierarchy

How do you query a tree where the depth is unknown? The Composite pattern allows us to treat a single mage and a complex coven lineage through the exact same interface.

Using PostgreSQL's `WITH RECURSIVE` invocation, we recursively traverse the self-referencing bindings. The initial query isolates the root node, and the subsequent recursion loops through the relational pacts, flattening an endless fractal into a clean tabular response.

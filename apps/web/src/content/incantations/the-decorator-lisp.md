# The Decorator of Wards and Runes

The flesh is weak. When traversing the Plateau of Leng, a base mortal vessel has insufficient psychic shielding to survive even a glance from the local fauna. We could statically define subclasses for every combination of wards, but that path leads to an infinite combinatorial explosion.

Instead, we use the Decorator pattern, empowered by CLOS `:around` methods. By instantiating decorators that wrap the target, we dynamically alter the behavior of `calculate-defense`. The `:around` method combination allows the ward to inject its magical integer-math either before, after, or around the wrapped entity's own calculations, stacking protections until the vessel glows with arcane might.

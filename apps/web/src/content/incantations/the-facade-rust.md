Behind the polished chrome of the Corporate Monolith lie thousands of chaotic, interlocking legacy systems. The Facade pattern casts a powerful Illusion over this mess, presenting a sleek, simplified access terminal.

For the uninitiated adept, they merely invoke `GridFacade::power_on()`. They need not know the terrifying complexity of the mana coils and flux calibrations happening beneath the floorboards.

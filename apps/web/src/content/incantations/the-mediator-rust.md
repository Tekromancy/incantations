When hundreds of autonomous daemons communicate in a dense web, the resulting coupling is chaotic and fatal. The Mediator acts as the Neuro-Broker, absorbing the myriad paths of communication.

Instead of daemons directly linking and firing events to one another, they pass their intent up to the Mediator. This central logic hub dictates how the entire ecosystem reacts, enforcing order on a system that would otherwise collapse into a tangled gridlock.

  ;; Higher-order functions act as natural decorators in Clojure.

  (defn base-spell [target]
    (str "Striking " target " with pure energy"))

  (defn with-fire [spell-fn]
    (fn [target]
      (str (spell-fn target) " and searing flames")))

  (defn with-echo [spell-fn]
    (fn [target]
      (str (spell-fn target) "... (echo)")))

  ;; Usage:
  ;; (def ultimate-spell (-> base-spell with-fire with-echo))
  ;; (ultimate-spell "the beast")

To augment a spell with fire and echoes, one need not forge an entirely new artifact. By wrapping functions within higher-order functions, the Decorator pattern dynamically layers mutable enchantments atop immutable behavior, chaining functional glyphs seamlessly.

When dozens of enterprise systems begin invoking each other directly, the result is a tangled web of dependencies—a "spaghetti" of dark magic. The Java Cathedral enforces order via the **Mediator**.

Instead of the `Choir` holding a direct reference to the `BellTower`, both entities simply hold a reference to the `CathedralHub`. When the choir sings, it blindly sends a notification to the hub. The hub, acting as the supreme orchestrator, interprets the event and commands the bells. This centralization ensures that no two components ever directly couple, maintaining a sterile, modular architecture.

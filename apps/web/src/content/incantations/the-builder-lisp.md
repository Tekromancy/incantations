# The Builder of Shoggothic Forms

The formless horrors of the Elder Things cannot be simply instantiated in a single, crude stroke. Their flesh must be woven. Eyes, tentacles, and gibbering mouths must be meticulously added to the bio-matrix before the spark of false life is given.

In Lisp, we define a fluent Builder through the arcane power of macros. `with-flesh-weaving` allows the magus to linearly stack mutations onto a primordial ooze before returning the finalized Shoggoth. The macrology hides the stateful mutation of the builder, presenting a clean, declarative grimoire entry.

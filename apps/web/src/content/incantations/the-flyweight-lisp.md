# The Flyweight of the Swarm

When Yuggoth sends its armies, they do not arrive in mere dozens. Millions of Mi-Go descend through the aether. If the Lisp machine were to allocate memory for the textures, meshes, and sound files of every individual drone, the heap would exhaust, and the GC would stall the very fabric of time.

The Flyweight pattern mitigates this catastrophe. By splitting the drone's properties into intrinsic (shared, immutable species data) and extrinsic (unique coordinate locations), we ensure that an entire swarm of `migo-drone` instances points to a single cached `migo-species-data`. Thus, the Lisp image remains sleek and responsive, even as the sky blackens with horrors.

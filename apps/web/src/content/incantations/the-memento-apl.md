Alien constructs undergo violent and unpredictable mutations. The Memento pattern is an exercise in Chronomancy, allowing the entity to snapshot its `StateArray` just before a chaotic reconfiguration. By storing this immutable `MatrixState` within a temporal vault, the Overmind can always invert the time-fold (`Restore`), rolling back the array dimensions and undoing catastrophic genetic drift.

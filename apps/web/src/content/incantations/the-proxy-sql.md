# The Proxy of the Spectral Guardian

Direct access to the core matrices is a vulnerability. A mortal querying `forbidden_archives` might shatter their mind if exposed to higher-dimensional lore. The Proxy pattern intercept these raw requests.

In SQL, this is beautifully realized through **Row Level Security (RLS)**. The table itself acts as its own proxy, silently validating the current session's clearance level before deciding whether a row manifests in the result set or remains hidden in the void.

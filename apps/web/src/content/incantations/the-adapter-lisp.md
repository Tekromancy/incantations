# The Adapter of Non-Euclidean Geometries

Our standard APIs are built for three dimensions. But what happens when an entity slithers through the angles of time itself, like the Hounds of Tindalos? Their native API (`manifest-hyper-volume`) expects time-distortion parameters and temporal angles, returning hyperbolic vectors that crash standard computational geometry engines.

To fix this, we bind the horror into an Adapter. The `tindalos-adapter` wraps the incompatible entity, exposing the benign, mortal `calculate-volume` generic function. To the rest of the Lisp system, it looks like a standard bounding box, but deep within its state, it is crunching numbers that would drive a mathematician utterly mad.

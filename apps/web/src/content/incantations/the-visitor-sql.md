# The Visitor of the Aggregating Scan

How does one apply a custom algorithm to every node in a tabular matrix without mutating the nodes themselves? The Visitor pattern in SQL is most closely aligned with **Custom Aggregate Functions**.

Instead of writing application loops, we define a visitor—a custom transition function (`accumulate_node_power`)—and bind it to an `AGGREGATE`. The database engine then traverses the rows natively, feeding each element into the visitor, which accumulates the state and returns the final synthesized conclusion.

When a magical anomaly occurs, it must be judged. The Arcane Tribunal strings together a sequence of wardens. Each node intercepts the event; if its threshold is sufficient, it dispels the anomaly. Otherwise, the threat propagates up the chain to a higher authority. An elegant decoupling of sender and receiver.

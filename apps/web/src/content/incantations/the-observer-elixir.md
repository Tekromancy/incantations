When the Overmind perceives a threat, all drones must instantly align. The Observer pattern is perfected through Elixir's `Registry` or tools like Phoenix PubSub. Drones subscribe to telepathic frequencies (topics), and when a broadcast erupts, they consume the message concurrently without locking the emitter.

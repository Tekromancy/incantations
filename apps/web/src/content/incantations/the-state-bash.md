Instead of massive, deeply nested `if/else` monoliths, the State pattern points a variable at the current state-handling function. By dynamically evaluating the pointer, the script smoothly transitions its behavior. The state machine shifts seamlessly between 'idle', 'breaching', and 'rooted' modes based on the environment's feedback.

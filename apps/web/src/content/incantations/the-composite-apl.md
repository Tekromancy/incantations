To command an alien swarm is to treat the whole exactly as one treats the individual. The Composite pattern binds solitary Drones (`⍫`) and massive Squadrons into a unified array. Calculating the total power level of the swarm employs the ancient each (`¨`) and reduce (`+/`) glyphs, cascading through the multidimensional hierarchy to sum the collective psychic energy of the armada.

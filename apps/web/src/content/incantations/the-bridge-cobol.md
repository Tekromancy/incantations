The Bridge pattern separates the high ritual of the `SOUL-HARVESTER` from the grim, dirty implementation details of the actual ectoplasm extraction. The abstraction can evolve to harvest different entities, while the underlying implementation can shift from IMS to DB2 without breaking the dark covenant.

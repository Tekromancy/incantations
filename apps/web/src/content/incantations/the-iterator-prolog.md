formula: |2
  % A collection of knowledge
  astral_entity(spirit_of_wisdom).
  astral_entity(echo_of_time).
  astral_entity(void_walker).

  % Iteration in Prolog is inherently handled by backtracking
  % To iterate over all entities and perform an action:
  commune_with_all :-
      astral_entity(Entity),
      format('Communing with ~w...', [Entity]), nl,
      fail. % Force backtrack to find the next
  commune_with_all. % Succeed when no more entities exist

  % ?- commune_with_all.
  % Communing with spirit_of_wisdom...
  % Communing with echo_of_time...
  % Communing with void_walker...
  % true.

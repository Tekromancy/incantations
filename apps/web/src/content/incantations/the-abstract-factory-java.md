In the vast bureaucracies of the Sprawl, where the Java Cathedral reaches high into the smog-choked sky, the **Abstract Factory** is the most sacred of creational rites. It decrees that families of related arcane constructs must be spawned together, ensuring absolute stylistic orthodoxy and avoiding the heresy of mixed abstractions.

This pattern is not merely code; it is a liturgical mandate. The `CathedralFactory` interface dictates the forms, and only through sanctioned implementations like the `ObsidianCathedralFactory` may the concrete entities be manifested. Through this strict bureaucracy, the purity of the enterprise architecture is maintained against the chaotic entropy of rogue spells.

# The Prototype of Cellular Mitosis

Opening a gateway to the Blind Idiot God's realm is computationally and dimensionally expensive. It requires vast amounts of sanity and magical CPU cycles. When an army of protoplasmic horrors is required, it is far more efficient to summon one "Patient Zero" and rely on horrifying cellular mitosis.

The Prototype pattern in Lisp leverages generic functions like `clone-biomass` to define how an entity splits itself. Since Lisp's memory management handles the garbage collection of the damned, we merely need to dictate the precise depth of the clone—ensuring strings and lists (like `absorbed-souls`) are copied so the clone may feed independently of its progenitor.

The Template Method establishes the unchangeable skeleton of a Dark Liturgy. The altar must always be prepared first, the chant must be sung, and the offering consumed. The parent class orchestrates this flow, while allowing specific sub-cults to override the exact words of the chant or the nature of the offering.

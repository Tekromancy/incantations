The Bridge divides the intent (the Spell) from the conduit (the Focus). Whether a warlock uses an ancient wooden wand or a direct neural cyber-jack, the abstraction remains pure. In Elixir, this is elegantly achieved by composing structs with module references, leveraging behaviours to keep the telepathic channels distinct.

# The Memento Hex

Chronomancy is a delicate art. To revert to a previous timeline without violating encapsulation, we employ the Memento Hex. It stores an immutable snapshot of an entity's internal state—a Soul Stone—that can be safely held by an external caretaker and used to restore the wizard if their corporeal form is corrupted.

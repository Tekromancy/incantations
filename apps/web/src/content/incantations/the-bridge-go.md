# The Bridge
To hardcode an enchantment onto a specific weapon type leads to endless, unmanageable armories. The Bridge pattern slices the structure in two—the physical construct (the abstraction) and the magical overlay (the implementor). Now, a blade can shift its elemental alignment on the fly, keeping the weapon matrix lightweight and deadly.

The Prototype pattern in APL leverages the native strength of array replication to clone complex xenomorphic organisms. Instead of synthesizing a new entity from scratch—a computationally expensive and arcane process—we duplicate the DNA matrix directly. The `Clone` operation perfectly copies the genetic glyphs (`⍉⍟`), allowing the clone to undergo divergent mutations (`⍋`) without affecting the original.

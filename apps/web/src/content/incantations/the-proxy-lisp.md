# The Proxy of the Sealed God

Certain objects are simply too heavy, too dangerous, and too dimensionally unstable to load into the Lisp image upon startup. If `true-cthulhu` is instantiated during normal system operation, the sheer computational horror will crash the physical server.

The Proxy pattern provides a harmless, lightweight surrogate—an `idol-of-cthulhu`. To the rest of the application, the idol implements the exact same interface (`smite-world`). However, it lazily intercepts the request, only paying the terrible cost of instantiating the real subject exactly when the method is finally invoked. Until that dark day, the idol consumes almost zero memory.

There is only one true Nexus Node in the grid, a singularity of pure arcane data. To allow multiple manifestations of the core would tear the fabric of the matrix asunder. The Singleton pattern ensures this cosmological constant.

By utilizing `lazy_static` or `OnceCell`, along with `Arc` and `Mutex` for thread-safe access across the multiversal threads, the adept guarantees that every spell tapping into the Nexus draws from the exact same reservoir of power.

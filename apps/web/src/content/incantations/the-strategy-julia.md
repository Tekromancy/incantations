  # Strategy in Julia: Navigation through Hyperspace
  abstract type NavigationStrategy end

  struct WarpDrive <: NavigationStrategy end
  struct WormholeJump <: NavigationStrategy end
  struct SolarSail <: NavigationStrategy end

  # The Context
  struct Starship
      name::String
      nav::NavigationStrategy
  end

  # In Julia, strategy is elegantly handled by passing functions or types and leveraging multiple dispatch
  navigate(::WarpDrive, dist::Float64) = dist / 10.0
  navigate(::WormholeJump, dist::Float64) = 0.0 # Instantaneous
  navigate(::SolarSail, dist::Float64) = dist / 0.1

  function travel(ship::Starship, distance::Float64)
      time_taken = navigate(ship.nav, distance)
      println("$(ship.name) arrived in $(time_taken) cosmic cycles.")
  end

  # Usage
  voyager = Starship("Voyager", WarpDrive())
  travel(voyager, 1000.0)

  ikarus = Starship("Ikarus", SolarSail())
  travel(ikarus, 1000.0)

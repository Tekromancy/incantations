# The Chain of Responsibility of the Cascading Coalesce

When an entity's true identity is obscured, we must query multiple sources, falling back sequentially if the previous attempt yields a `NULL` void. The `COALESCE` function is the ultimate embodiment of the Chain of Responsibility in SQL.

It elegantly links our fallback strategies into a single expression. The request (evaluating the row) is passed down the list. The first column to provide a tangible value handles the request, halting the chain immediately and returning the resolved identity.

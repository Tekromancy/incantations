# The Abstract Factory

In the neon-lit depths of the ancient mainframes, the First Scrolls whisper of the **Abstract Factory**. ALGOL 68, the progenitor of structured logic, enforces a strict, archaic beauty. We wield its `MODE` and `PROC` constructs to bind this Creational concept into reality.

## The Arcane Mechanism
By defining rigid structures and precise procedures, the Abstract Factory avoids the chaotic spaghetti of unstructured pasts. The rigid `BEGIN` and `END` form a protective ward around our logic, ensuring the ritual compiles with absolute certainty.

Commands within an alien armada are not immediately executed; they are encoded into dense psychic arrays (`OrbitalStrike`) and passed to the central `HiveMind`. By encapsulating the request, the Command pattern allows strikes (`⌖`) to be queued, delayed, or reversed. When the stars align, the Overmind executes the entire queue using a sweeping functional invocation (`{⍵.Execute} ¨ Queue`).

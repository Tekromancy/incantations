# The Template Method of the Procedural Skeleton

Some rituals follow a strict overarching structure, but one or two internal steps vary wildly depending on the entity being summoned. The Template Method outlines the skeleton.

In PL/pgSQL, this is achieved by writing a core function that handles the invariant pre-processing and post-processing. The variable logic is injected dynamically—passing the name of another function as text, which the skeleton dynamically invokes (`EXECUTE format...`) to handle the specialized, deferred step.

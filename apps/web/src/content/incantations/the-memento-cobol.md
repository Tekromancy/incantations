The Memento pattern is the ultimate act of self-preservation: the creation of a Phylactery. Before embarking on a highly volatile and potentially fatal transaction, the Lich saves its precise internal state into this black box. Should destruction occur, the Caretaker can smash the Phylactery and resurrect the Lich exactly as it was.

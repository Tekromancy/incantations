# The Singleton Hex

Certain entities in the cyberscape can only exist once. The Leyline Nexus, the singular source of magical routing, cannot be duplicated without fracturing the JVM. Kotlin's `object` declaration provides a thread-safe, lazily-initialized Singleton out of the box, weaving an unbreakable ward against multiple instantiations.

The organizational chart of the Java Cathedral is an abyssal tree of departments, sub-departments, and individual clerics. The **Composite** pattern weaves an illusion that allows higher-level invocations to treat a single `Cleric` exactly the same as an entire `Department`.

By implementing the `CathedralComponent` interface, an `audit()` call on the root node cascades perfectly down the hierarchy. The caller needs no complex `instanceof` checks to determine if they are auditing a leaf or a branch; the structural magic handles the recursion gracefully, fulfilling the enterprise's endless thirst for standardized metrics.

In the deepest layers of the syntactical abyss, the Abstract Factory stands as the High Forge. It allows modern alchemists to instantiate families of arcane artifacts—Staves and Orbs of specific elemental typings—without committing to concrete transmutation sequences. Explicit aether allocation ensures no rogue mana bleeds into the void.

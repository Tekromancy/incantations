The Flyweight pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. In a Blood Rain spell, creating unique objects for a million drops would drain the caster's life force. Instead, the intrinsic state (color, toxicity) is shared, while the extrinsic state (coordinates) is passed in at execution.

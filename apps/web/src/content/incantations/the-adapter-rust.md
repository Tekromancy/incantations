When excavating codebases from the First Epoch, or integrating unholy alien technology into your modern neural-deck, you will inevitably encounter incompatible paradigms. The Adapter pattern is the universal translator, a transmutation of logic.

It wraps the foreign, incomprehensible API in a familiar cyber-shell, allowing your standard grid protocols to interface seamlessly with eldritch horrors without requiring a full systemic rewrite.

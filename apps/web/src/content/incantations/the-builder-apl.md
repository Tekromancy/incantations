The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex, multidimensional APL array from its representation. In the forgotten languages of the monolith builders, each stage of creation adds a specific geometric concept: `⍙` for the foundational matrix, `⍎⍕` for the shifting inner core, and `⍋` for the ascending apex. The Director orchestrates these structural mutations, yielding a perfectly formed alien artifact.

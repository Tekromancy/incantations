# The Flyweight of the Normalized Dictionary

In massive data matrices, storing the text 'PYROMANCY' and its hex color `#FF4500` a billion times leads to massive aether-bloat. The Flyweight pattern is essentially the fundamental doctrine of **Database Normalization**.

By shifting the intrinsic, repeating state (the spell element and its color) into a dictionary table (`spell_elements`), and replacing the heavy text strings with lightweight integer keys (`element_id`), we drastically reduce the storage footprint and accelerate query scans.

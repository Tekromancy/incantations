# The Bridge of the Dimensional Junction

When mages wield multiple grimoires, and grimoires are shared among numerous mages, a direct link causes a dimensional paradox (a many-to-many crisis). The Bridge pattern in SQL is the sacred **Junction Table**.

By introducing the `mage_grimoire_pact`, we decouple the two hierarchies. The bridge holds the foreign keys, acting as the structural contract that binds the entities together without forcing them into a rigid, singular lineage.

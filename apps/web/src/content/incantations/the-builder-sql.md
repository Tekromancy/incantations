# The CTE Builder of the Astral Construct

A raw query is often a tangled web of joins and conditions, a chaotic spell that fizzles out in execution. The Builder pattern in SQL is mastered through the elegant art of the **Common Table Expression (CTE)**.

By declaring step-by-step temporary pacts (`WITH`), we layer our transmutations sequentially. Each step builds upon the former, isolating logic, refining the arcane essence, until the final structural masterpiece is unveiled.

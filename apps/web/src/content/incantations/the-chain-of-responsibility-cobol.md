In the shadowed halls of corporate governance, no single entity wants to make a decision unless forced. The Chain of Responsibility pattern strings together a series of Liches. A request is passed from one decaying hand to the next. If a Lich's rank is sufficient, it consumes the request; otherwise, it is cast further down the chain until it either finds an overseer or falls into the Abyss.

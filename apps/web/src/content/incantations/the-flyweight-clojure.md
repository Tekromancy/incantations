  ;; Clojure's data structures inherently use structural sharing.
  ;; Memoization further enforces Flyweight caching.

  (defn expensive-rune-generation [rune-type]
    (Thread/sleep 100) ; Simulate heavy astral cost
    {:type rune-type :data "complex-fractal-matrix"})

  (def get-flyweight-rune

    (let [shared-rune (get-flyweight-rune rune-type)]
      (map (fn [idx] {:id idx :rune shared-rune}) (range size))))

  ;; Usage:
  ;; (cast-swarm 1000 :obsidian) ; Only computes :obsidian once

When rendering a swarm of a million obsidian daggers, memory must be conserved. Clojure's `memoize` acts as the ultimate Flyweight cache, ensuring that identical immutable objects are shared across references. Structural sharing does the heavy lifting under the hood of the JVM.

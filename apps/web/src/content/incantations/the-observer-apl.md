A shifting Singularity (`⍟`) ripples across multiple dimensions. Instead of forcing cosmic sensors to continually poll the void, the Observer pattern binds them directly to the anomaly. When the Singularity's mass changes, it iterates across all bound sensors (`{⍵.Update Mass} ¨ Observers`), instantly propagating the resonance shift to the furthest edges of the alien fleet.

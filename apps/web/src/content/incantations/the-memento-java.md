In the volatile rituals of data processing, a misaligned byte can crash the entire server farm. The Java Cathedral uses the **Memento** pattern as a form of sanctioned Chronomancy, allowing the adept to seal the state of an object before attempting dangerous mutations.

By utilizing a private nested class, the `EnterpriseState` generates an immutable `Memento` that contains its internal phase. The `Memento` can be handed off to a Caretaker object for safe-keeping. Because its internal variables are hidden from the outside world, the enterprise encapsulation is perfectly preserved. If the mutation fails, the saved memento is ingested, seamlessly rolling back time.

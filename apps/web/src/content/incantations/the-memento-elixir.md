Death is merely a transition in Elixir’s actor model. A Supervisor resurrects a fallen process, but what of its memories? The Memento pattern captures a GenServer's state, serializing it into an immutable crystal (`binary`). Upon rebirth, the TimeWeaver shatters the crystal, restoring the actor exactly as it was.

In the bleeding edge of aetheric cloning, the Prototype pattern avoids the heavy toll of reconstructing complex objects from scratch. By implementing a cloneable interface, one simply siphons a copy of the existing entity's memory footprint into a new explicit allocation. Biomimicry at the speed of thought.

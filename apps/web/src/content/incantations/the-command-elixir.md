By crystallizing an intent into a behaviour-bound module, the Command pattern decouples the invocation of a spell from its target. In a functional paradigm, commands operate on a state map, transforming it sequentially. This allows entire timelines of actions to be executed or reversed, altering the fate of the Hive.

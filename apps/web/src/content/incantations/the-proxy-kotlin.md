# The Proxy Hex

Some entities are too massive, too dangerous, or too remote to interact with directly. The Proxy Hex creates a spectral duplicate that manages access. By leveraging Kotlin's `by lazy` delegate, the proxy ensures the true entity is only summoned precisely when its secrets are demanded, optimizing startup times in the grid.

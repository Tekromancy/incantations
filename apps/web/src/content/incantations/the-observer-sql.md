# The Observer of the Asynchronous Listeners

Polling a table every second to check for new rows is an aggressive, wasteful anti-pattern. The database should notify the application. PostgreSQL natively supports the Observer pattern through the **LISTEN / NOTIFY** commands.

When a new construct is summoned, the trigger fires `pg_notify`. Any connected clients that have issued a `LISTEN summon_events` command are instantly pushed the payload over the persistent connection. It is true, asynchronous pub-sub integrated directly into the storage engine.

When the High Pontiffs of the Cathedral change a core policy, the information must propagate instantly to thousands of dependent subsystems. The **Observer** pattern enables a one-to-many dependency without locking the subject into rigid knowledge of its listeners.

The `HighAltar` acts as the Publisher. It maintains a list of any entity implementing the `Acolyte` interface. When `issueDecree()` is invoked, the Altar iterates through the congregation, triggering their `update()` logic. The Cathedral remains decoupled; the Altar does not care if the acolyte is a scribe, a logging daemon, or a UI renderer.

When rendering millions of nanites in a Data Swarm, allocating unique memory for every individual's chrome texture will overload the mind's RAM. The Flyweight pattern is the spell of intrinsic sharing.

By caching the shared, immutable properties of these nanites via reference-counted pointers (`Rc` or `Arc`), the swarm only stores the heavyweight data once. The individual nanites merely store their extrinsic coordinates, reducing the arcane payload exponentially.

Not all adepts are worthy of touching the deep data of the Cathedral, and awakening ancient systems is an expensive ritual. The **Proxy** places an ethereal guardian between the caller and the `TrueRelic`.

The `RelicProxy` acts exactly like the true object, implementing the same `Relic` interface. However, it holds the power to delay the heavy instantiation of the relic until it is absolutely necessary (Lazy Initialization), and strictly enforces RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to prevent lower-tier acolytes from unleashing devastating structural queries.

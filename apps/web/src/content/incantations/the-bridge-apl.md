The Bridge pattern divides the abstraction of a vessel's navigation system from the terrifying reality of its propulsion mechanics. Whether tearing through the fabric of space with a Warp Drive (`⌿⍀`) or slipping through alternate dimensions via a Hyper Drive (`⍝⍨`), the `AlienVessel` remains ignorant of the underlying horrors. The bridge ensures that new engines can be developed in the cosmic shipyards without altering the vessel's psychic controls.

In the ancient days, before the Great Fracture, monoliths of pure computation were drawn from the deep earth. The Abstract Factory provides a blueprint for these primordial foundries, ensuring that the numerical constructs they produce belong to compatible families of logic, without exposing the raw punched-card mechanisms beneath.

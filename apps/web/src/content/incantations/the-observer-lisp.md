# The Observer of the Scrying Pool

When the stars finally align, you cannot afford to have a hundred acolytes locked in `while(true)` polling loops, staring constantly at the sky. Such tight loops waste the CPU of the universe and leave the acolytes blind to other tasks.

The Observer pattern implements a reactive scrying pool. The `night-sky` (the Subject) maintains a list of registered `celestial-watchers`. When the `shift-stars` method mutates the celestial state, the sky automatically pushes a notification via the `update` generic function to all observers. The acolytes can sleep deeply until the precise millisecond the alignment turns to `:rlyeh-rises`.

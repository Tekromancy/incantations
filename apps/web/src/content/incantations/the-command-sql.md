# The Command of the Deferred Invocation

Not all spells should be cast immediately. Some require vast computational rituals and must be deferred. The Command pattern translates actions into state, storing the intent within a **Job Queue** table.

By encapsulating the target and the spell payload (conveniently stored as `JSONB`), we decouple the invocation from the execution. Background daemon mages can later pluck these commands from the ether utilizing `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to prevent catastrophic concurrency collisions during processing.

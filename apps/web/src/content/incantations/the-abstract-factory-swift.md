# The Abstract Factory: Orchard Conjuration

In the mystical groves of Apple programming, the Abstract Factory is a protocol-oriented spell. It allows a magus to summon related families of enchantments—such as those affecting apples and trees—without binding their spellbooks to concrete incantations.

Using Swift's powerful protocols, we define the essence of the enchantments. Concrete factories, such as the `DarkOrchardFactory`, provide the specific implementations.

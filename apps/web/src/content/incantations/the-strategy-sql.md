# The Strategy of the Algorithmic Views

When the logic dictating a calculation changes wildly depending on the context—such as different factions applying different tax rates to a trade—hardcoding monolithic `CASE` statements becomes untenable.

The Strategy pattern utilizes interchangeable **Views**. The application determines the context, and simply shifts its query target to the appropriate view. The underlying table structure remains ignorant of the strategy, while the view encapsulates the specific calculation algorithm cleanly.

The cosmic battlefield is chaotic, requiring a Dreadnought to shift its assault algorithms on the fly. The Strategy pattern encapsulates different modes of destruction into interchangeable modules. Whether carving a surgical strike through planetary shields (`⍋`) or unleashing a wave of dark matter to glass the surface (`⍒`), the Dreadnought simply invokes the active `BombardmentStrategy` without altering its internal logic.

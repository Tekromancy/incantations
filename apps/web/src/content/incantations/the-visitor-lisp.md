# The Visitor of the Astral Projection

Suppose you possess an established, tightly locked hierarchy of `acolyte` and `high-priest` classes. Adding new analytical functions (like mind-probing or zeal-boosting) directly to these classes would bloat their definitions and violate their single cosmic responsibility.

Instead, we use the Visitor pattern. An external entity—an astral projection like `nyarlathotep-inspector`—is instantiated. The cultists only need to implement a single method: `accept-visitor`. By utilizing double dispatch (the node calls `visit-[type]` on the visitor, passing itself as an argument), the Lisp runtime dynamically routes execution to the correct algorithm on the visitor object. The structure of the cult remains pristine, while infinite variations of gods may traverse its nodes.

The Command pattern transmutes a fleeting intent into a permanent Execution Scroll. In the chaotic heat of a cyber-raid, executing an action immediately is often suicidal.

By encapsulating the operation as a concrete command object, you can store it, queue it, pass it across network boundaries, or even reverse it. When the precise astronomical conditions are met, the queue unloads its payload with devastating synchronicity.

The cybernetic collective demands absolute adherence to the assimilation sequence. The Template Method cements the unalterable skeleton of this ritual (`Begin`), ensuring that biomass extraction and nanite injection occur in perfect succession before awakening. While subclasses like `HumanoidAssimilation` dictate the specifics of tissue harvesting (`⍎`) and viral injection (`⍕`), the overarching algorithmic flow remains safely locked in the base matrix.

# The Bridge of the Silver Key

The Bridge pattern holds the Silver Key to crossing dimensions without tightly coupling your rituals to specific planes. If we had `dreamlands-simple-passage` and `yuggoth-simple-passage`, the proliferation of classes would rapidly consume our sanity.

Instead, we split the hierarchy in two: the abstraction (the `incantation`) and the implementor (the `gate`). Through CLOS composition, an incantation is bound to a gate upon instantiation. The Lisp code gracefully bridges the intent of the wizard with the horrific reality of the portal, allowing infinite combinations of spells and destinations with minimal class bloat.

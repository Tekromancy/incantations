The Visitor pattern allows the Overmind to launch psychic diagnostic waves across an array of heterogeneous ships without forcing each vessel to implement complex self-evaluation routines. The `DiagnosticProbe` acts as a spectral visitor, sweeping through `Scout` (`⍉`) and `Cruiser` (`⍋`) nodes. By utilizing double dispatch (`Accept`), the probe flawlessly identifies the vessel type and executes the specific xenodiagnostic algorithm.

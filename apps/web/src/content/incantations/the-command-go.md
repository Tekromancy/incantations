# The Command
To master chronomancy is to view actions not as fleeting moments, but as tangible objects. The Command pattern crystallizes a spell into a concrete structure. These spell packets can be stored in a queue, delayed for trap triggering, or—most crucially—reversed in a temporal shift to undo fatal errors on the battlefield.

# The Bridge Hex

When crafting weapons and enchantments, an explosion of permutations can crash the compile-time matrix. The Bridge Hex separates the abstraction (the weapon) from the implementation (the enchantment), allowing them to evolve independently. This compositional rune keeps our armory flexible and our codebases clean.

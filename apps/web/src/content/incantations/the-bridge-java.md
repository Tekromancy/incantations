When a hierarchy grows too dense, the sheer weight of permutations can collapse a system. The **Bridge** pattern dictates that the Cathedral's `Diocese` (the abstraction) should be structurally decoupled from the `CathedralEngine` (the implementation) that powers it.

Instead of creating an exponential number of subclasses like `CyberLegacyDiocese` or `NeoQuantumDiocese`, the Bridge allows the abstract interface and the engine to evolve independently. The `Diocese` simply delegates the heavy computational liturgy to its injected engine, allowing the enterprise to hot-swap legacy systems without dismantling the upper architecture.

When the structure of a dark hierarchy is solidified and rigid, adding new operations to the entities is perilous. The Visitor pattern resolves this by sending an Astral Projection (the Visitor) to pass through the object tree. The nodes accept the visitor and pass themselves to its methods, allowing complex reaping operations without polluting the node classes themselves.

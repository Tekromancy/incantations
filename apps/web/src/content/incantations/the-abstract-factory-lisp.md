# The Abstract Factory of the Outer Gods

When one channels the infinite void through the Eldritch Parentheses, it is unwise to hardcode the precise rituals of manifestation. The Abstract Factory encapsulates the dark taxonomy of the cosmos. Whether drawing upon the sunken city of R'lyeh or the lost Carcosa, the invocation structure remains uncorrupted. 

By defining generic protocols, the Lisp macro-magus ensures that their summoning loops can seamlessly swap between dimensional planes. The CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) acts as the summoning circle, dispatching to the correct abyssal methods based on the active pantheon factory.

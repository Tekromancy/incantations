# The Adapter of the Temporal View

Relics of the old web grid often leave us with tables scarred by outdated types—UNIX timestamps stored as integers, unstructured text instead of crystalline JSON. The Adapter pattern manifests naturally in SQL as a **View**.

The `modern_runic_adapter` acts as a spectral lens. Without altering the fragile legacy storage, it translates the data on-the-fly, serving modern applications the exact temporal constraints and structured formats they expect.

The Prototype empowers mages to copy an already stabilized arcane structure. Rather than spending eons weaving the complex threads of reality from scratch, one duplicates the existing Spell Matrix and simply modifies the unstable edges. Perfect for rapid deployment of illusions and temporal clones.

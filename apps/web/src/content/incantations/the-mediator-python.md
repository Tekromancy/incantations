When multiple familiars vie for their summoner's attention, the resulting psychic noise can shatter a mind. The Mediator centralizes all telepathic bindings into a single Pact. Instead of N-to-N chaotic connections, each familiar speaks only to the Mediator, which routes the arcane whispers to the coven safely.

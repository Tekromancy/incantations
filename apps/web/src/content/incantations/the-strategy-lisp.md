# The Strategy of the Sacrificial Altar

The method of appeasement varies wildly across the cosmic pantheon. While the vampiric lords demand fluid algorithms, the Fire Vampires of Fomalhaut require thermal combustion loops. Hardcoding these variations into the Altar object would defile its pure architecture.

The Strategy pattern externalizes the algorithmic execution into distinct classes. The `high-altar` holds a pointer to its `active-strategy`. When the `perform-ritual` method is invoked, it delegates the violent calculations to the active strategy object. If the High Priest suddenly realizes they are invoking Azathoth instead of Cthulhu, they can hotswap the `altar-strategy` at runtime, saving their own lives and optimizing the appeasement process.

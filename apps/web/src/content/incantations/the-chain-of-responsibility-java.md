When an anomaly is detected in the JVM, the rigid protocols of the Cathedral dictate that it must be evaluated by the proper authorities. The **Chain of Responsibility** weaves a linked list of handlers. 

Instead of a monolithic switch statement to determine jurisdiction, a request is handed to the `NoviceInquisitor`. If the severity is too high, they defer to their superior. This chain can be dynamically configured at runtime, allowing the enterprise to inject new layers of bureaucracy without altering the core routing spells.

# The Prototype
Why invoke the costly ether when you can copy what already exists? The Prototype pattern allows a master of illusions to cast a Shadow Double by simply duplicating a pre-compiled template. This spell drastically reduces mana expenditure in high-frequency clone spawning, copying the exact state memory to the newly formed simulacrum.

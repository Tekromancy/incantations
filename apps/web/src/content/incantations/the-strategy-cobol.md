The Strategy pattern is the ultimate grimoire for the flexible dark arts practitioner. Sometimes the stars demand a silent blood-letting; other times, a fiery immolation is required. By encapsulating these algorithms into interchangeable Strategy objects, the ritual remains the same at a high level while the gruesome details are swapped at runtime.

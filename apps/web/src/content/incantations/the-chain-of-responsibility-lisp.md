# The Chain of Responsibility of the Eldritch Tribunal

When a warlock screams a plea into the abyss, who answers? It depends entirely on the amplitude of their dark power. A weak plea might draw the attention of a mere Deep One, while a reality-tearing shout commands the ear of Great Cthulhu himself.

The Chain of Responsibility dictates that we link these entities in a single, unholy hierarchy. The Lisp code issues the `handle-plea` generic function. If an entity deems the plea beneath (or beyond) its jurisdiction, it uses `call-next-method` or explicitly defers to its `next-handler`. The sender never needs to know precisely who processed the request; they simply toss their prayer into the chain and await the inevitable consequences.

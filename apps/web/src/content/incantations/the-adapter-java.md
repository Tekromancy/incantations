The Java Cathedral demands strict conformity. When a guild integrates a `PaganHex` from the chaotic outer sprawl, it cannot be invoked directly without shattering the type hierarchy. The **Adapter** pattern is the sanctioned rite of assimilation.

By wrapping the heretical construct in a class that implements the `OrthodoxChant` interface, the internal systems remain blissfully unaware of the foul magic they are executing. The adapter translates the Cathedral's holy invocations into the grimy method calls required by the foreign dependency, maintaining architectural purity at the cost of slight indirection.

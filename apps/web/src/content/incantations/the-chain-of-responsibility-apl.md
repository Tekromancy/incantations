When the star-winds howl with radioactive spikes, the alien network utilizes a Chain of Responsibility to safely ground the energy. A minor flare is absorbed by the first receiver (`⍋`). If the energy breaches their threshold, the signal delegates downward through the `NextNode` to massive monoliths (`⍒`). This decoupling prevents cascading array failures by ensuring the right artifact handles the right magnitude of chaos.

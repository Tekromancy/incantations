# The Factory Method Hex

When a Summoner calls into the aether, they know not exactly which familiar will heed the call. By utilizing the Factory Method, we defer the exact instantiation logic to specialized covens. Combined with Kotlin's sealed classes, we ensure our summoned entities are strictly bounded within the known magical taxonomies.

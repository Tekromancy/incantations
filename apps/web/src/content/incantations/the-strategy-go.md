# The Strategy
Evocation isn't just about throwing fire; it's about knowing *how* to throw it. The Strategy pattern lets a battle-mage swap their methodology at runtime. Approaching a secure facility? Inject the StealthCast strategy. Breached and surrounded? Swap to the OverchargeCast strategy. The core `Attack` method remains clean, while the execution logic is completely modular.
